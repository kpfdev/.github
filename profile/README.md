## KPF Software Development

The KPF development team will act as the connective tissue for all technical development at KPF. Leveraging emergent technologies to support and augment the design process by creating intuitive, beautiful, insightful, and honest software.

## Goal

The development team will foster positive community for software engineering, front-end (UI/UX) software development, and software architecture, by collaborating professionally to create the best software solutions possible. This is accomplished by well documented code, SOLID design principles, thoughtful code reviews, and knowledge sharing. Many design and technical teams at KPF understand the initiatives that need to be developed, but often don't have the capacity, expertise, and continuity to finish and maintain projects. That is where the KPF Dev team comes in - we will collaborate with the in-house technical and non technical teams to understand their pain points, and create software where needed to solve the given problem within the architectural design practice. It is crucial that projects taken by the Dev team are outlined and properly scoped for long term maintenance and success.
